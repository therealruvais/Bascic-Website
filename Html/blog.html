                        Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people's thinking. -Steve Jobs
                        If life were predictable it would cease to be life, and be without flavor. -Eleanor Roosevelt
                        If you look at what you have in life, you'll always have more. If you look at what you don't have in life, you'll never have enough. -Oprah Winfrey
                        If you set your goals ridiculously high and it's a failure, you will fail above everyone else's success. -James Cameron</p><br>
